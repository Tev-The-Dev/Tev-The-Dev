I am a software engineer. Let's be honest, I am a student studying Software Engieering. I have some experience in C++ as it was my first language, and firsts always have a place in hearts. That being said, after completing my Japanese Language and Culture degree and spending some years as a teacher in Japan, I decided to go back to school to get another degree in Software Engineering. If you want to know more about Japan, I'd be more than happy to chat, just message me. Anyways, I have always been interested in coding and software developement, but I also wanted to go to Japan. I chose Japan first and don't regret it. Now that I am back pursuing a CS degree, I still go back to Japan yearly for family and friends, but now I'm focused on developing myself further by learning Fullstack and Python. (It's what my school wants lol). In any case, let's learn and grow together. よろしくお願いいたします。
